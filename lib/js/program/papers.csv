Combining these optically inverse devices, especially in a coaxial manner, creates the possibility of a new computer-vision technology. The “Smart Headlight,” currently under development at Carnegie MellonÐƒfs Robotics Institute, is one example:   a device that can “erase” raindrops or snowflakes from a driverÐƒfs sight, allowing for continuous use of the “high beams” mode while not causing glare against oncoming drivers, and enhance the appearance of important objects, such as pedestrians.  In that sense, it constitutes a “genuine” augmented reality, manipulating the reality for how it appears to a viewer, rather than merely overlaying objects on the image of the reality.

However, little attention in this body of work has examined how to involve and guide human workers in fabricating larger-scale structures. We propose a novel model of crowdsourced fabrication, in which a large number of workers and volunteers are guided through the process of building a pre-designed structure. The process is facilitated by an intelligent construction space capable of guiding individual workers and coordinating the overall build process. More specifically, we explore the use of smartwatches, indoor location sensing, and instrumented construction materials to provide real-time guidance to workers, coordinated by a foreman engine that manages the overall build process. We report on a three day deployment of our system to construct a 12’-tall bamboo pavilion with assistance from more than one hundred volunteer workers, and reflect on observations and feedback collected during the exhibit.",uist1001,Full,"Reprise: A Design Tool for Specifying, Generating, and Customizing 3D Printable Adaptations on Everyday Objects",16245,Xiang 'Anthony',,Chen,xiangchen@acm.org,Human-Computer Interaction Institute,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,35907,Jeeeun,,Kim,jeeeun.kim@colorado.edu,Computer Science,"University of Colorado, Boulder",Boulder,CO,USA,,,,,,1182,Jennifer,,Mankoff,jmankoff@cs.cmu.edu,Human Computer Interaction Institute,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,1476,Tovi,,Grossman,tovi.grossman@autodesk.com,,Autodesk Research,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,51680,Stelian,,Coros,scoros@cmu.edu,Robotics Institute,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,PA,USA,,,,,,1007,Scott,E,Hudson,scott.hudson@cs.cmu.edu,Human-Computer Interaction Institute,Carnegie Mellon,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Everyday tools and objects often need to be customized for an unplanned use or adapted for specific user, such as adding a bigger pull to a zipper or a larger grip for a pen. The advent of low-cost 3D printing offers the possibility to rapidly construct a wide range of such adaptations. However, while 3D printers are now affordable enough for even home use, the tools needed to design custom adaptations normally require skills that are beyond users with limited 3D modeling experience.  \  \ In this paper, we describe Reprise--a design tool for specifying, generating, customizing and fitting adaptations onto existing household objects. Reprise allows users to express at a high level what type of action is applied to an object.  Based on this high level specification, Reprise automatically generates adaptations. Users can use simple sliders to customize the adaptations to better suit their particular needs and preferences, such as increasing the tightness for gripping, enhancing torque for rotation, or making a larger base for stability. Finally, Reprise provides a toolkit of fastening methods and support structures for fitting the adaptations onto existing objects. \  \ To validate our approach, we used Reprise to replicate 15 existing adaptation examples, each of which represents a specific category in a design space distilled from an analysis of over 3000 cases found in the literature and online communities.

However, saving information is challenging on mobile devices, where the small screen and font sizes combined with the inaccuracy of finger based touch screens makes it time consuming and stressful for people to select and save text for future use. Furthermore, beyond the challenge of simply selecting a region of bounded text on a mobile device, in many learning and data exploration tasks the boundaries of what text may be relevant and useful later are themselves uncertain for the user. In contrast to previous approaches which focused on speeding up the selection process by making the identification of hard boundaries faster, we introduce the idea of intentionally supporting uncertain input in the context of saving information during complex reading and information exploration. We embody this idea in a system that uses force touch and fuzzy bounding boxes along with posthoc expandable context to support identifying and saving information in an intentionally uncertain way on mobile devices.

The results indicate that with <30 minutes of learning, haptic learning of finger tap semaphoric gestures is comparable to visual learning and maintains its recall on the second day.",uist2457,Full,GyroVR: Simulating Inertia in Virtual Reality using Head Worn Flywheels,37508,Jan,,Gugenheimer,jan.gugenheimer@uni-ulm.de,Institute of Media Informatics,Ulm University,Ulm,,Germany,,,,,,46214,Dennis,,Wolf,dennis.wolf@uni-ulm.de,Institute of Media Informatics,Ulm University,Ulm,,Germany,,,,,,54317,Eythor,R,Eiriksson,eythore@gmail.com,Applied Mathematics and Computer Science,Technical University of Denmark,Kgs.

Motions such as flying, diving or floating in outer space generate kinesthetic forces onto our body which impede movement and are currently not represented in VR. We simulate those kinesthetic forces by attaching flywheels to the users head, leveraging the gyroscopic effect of resistance when changing the spinning axis of rotation. GyroVR is an ungrounded, wireless and self contained device allowing the user to freely move inside the virtual environment. The generic shape allows to attach it to different positions on the users body. We evaluated the impact of GyroVR onto different mounting positions on the head (back and front) in terms of immersion, enjoyment and simulator sickness.

Telescope helps users understand unfamiliar website code through a composite view they control by adjusting JavaScript detail, scoping the runtime timeline, and triggering relational links between JS, HTML, and website components. To support these affordances on the open web, Telescope instruments the JavaScript in a website without request intercepts using a novel sleight-of-hand technique, then watches for traces emitted from the website. In a case study across seven popular websites, Telescope helped identify less than 150 lines of front-end code out of tens of thousands that accurately describe the desired interaction in six of the sites.

To address this problem, we present CodeMend, a system to support finding and integration of code. CodeMend leverages a neural embedding model to jointly model natural language and code as mined from large Web and code datasets. We also demonstrate a novel, mixed-initiative, interface to support query and integration steps. Through CodeMend, end-users describe their goal in natural language.

Meta functions are shareable via URL and instrumented to record runtime data. Combining thousands of Meta functions with their collective runtime data, we demonstrate tools including an optimizer that replaces your function with a more efficient version written by someone else, an auto-patcher that saves your program from crashing by finding equivalent functions in the community, and a proactive linter that warns you when a function fails elsewhere in the community. We find that professional programmers are able to use Meta for complex tasks (creating new Meta functions that, for example, cross-validate a logistic regression), and that Meta is able to find 44 optimizations (for a 1.45 times average speedup) and 5 bug fixes across the crowd.",uist4939,Full,Next-Point Prediction Metrics for Perceived Spatial Errors,12363,Mathieu,,Nancel,mathieu@nancel.net,Cheriton School of Computer Science,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Ontario,Canada,,Aalto University,Espoo,,Finland,3433,Daniel,,Vogel,dvogel@uwaterloo.ca,School of Computer Science,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,22675,Bruno,,De Araujo,brar@dgp.toronto.edu,Department of Computer Science,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,Tactual Labs,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,14062,Ricardo,,Jota,jotacosta@dgp.toronto.edu,,Tactual Labs,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,3033,Géry,,Casiez,gery.casiez@lifl.fr,,Université de Lille,Lille,,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Touch screens have a delay between user input and corresponding visual interface feedback, called input ``latency'' (or ``lag'').

Designing these ``next-point prediction'' methods is challenging, and there have been no standard metrics to compare different approaches. We introduce metrics to quantify the probability of 7 spatial error ``side-effects'' caused by next-point prediction methods.

While Guiard's framework has been widely applied in HCI, for bimanual interfaces where each hand interacts via direct touch, subtle limitations of multi-touch technologies’as well as limitations in conception and design’mean that the resulting interfaces often cannot fully adhere to Guiard's principles even if they want to. The interactions are fundamentally ambiguous because the system does not know which hand, left or right, contributes each touch. But by integrating additional context from wearable devices, our system can identify which user is touching, as well as distinguish what hand they use to do so.

We present a user study comparing this technique to direct-touch, showing that users are slightly slower but can utilise one-handed use with less physical effort. To enable interaction with small targets, we introduce CursorShift, a method that uses gaze to provide users temporal control over cursors during direct-touch interactions. Taken together, users can employ three techniques on tablets: direct-touch, gaze and touch, and cursor input. In three applications, we explore how these techniques can coexist in the same UI and demonstrate how tablet tasks can be performed with thumb-only input of the holding hand, and with it describe novel interaction techniques for gaze based tablet interaction.",uist2777,Full,Predicting Finger-Touch Accuracy Based on the Dual Gaussian Distribution Model,9137,Xiaojun,,Bi,xjunbi@gmail.com,Google,Inc.,Mountain View,California,United States,,,,,,1220,Shumin,,Zhai,zhai@acm.org,Google,Inc.,Mountain View,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Accurately predicting the accuracy of finger-touch target acquisition is crucial for designing touchscreen UI and for modeling complex and higher level touch interaction behaviors.

We evaluated the model by comparing the predicted success rates with empirical measures for three types of targets including 1-dimensional vertical and horizontal, and 2-dimensional circular targets.

Using this new source of high-fidelity data, we uncover a wide range of applications. For example, we use bio-acoustic data to classify hand gestures such as flicks, claps, scratches, and taps, which combine with on-device motion tracking to create a wide range of expressive input modalities. Bio-acoustic sensing can also detect the vibrations of grasped mechanical or motor-powered objects, enabling passive object recognition that can augment everyday experiences with context-sensitive functionality. Finally, we can generate structured vibrations using a transducer, and show that arbitrary data can be transmitted through the body.

We believe that if direct manipulation interfaces were to (a) use general-purpose programs as the representation format, and (b) expose those programs to the user, then experts could customize these systems in powerful new ways and non-experts could enjoy some of the benefits of programmable systems. \  \ In recent work, we presented a prototype SVG editor called Sketch-n-Sketch that offered a step towards this vision. In that system, the user wrote a program in a general-purpose lambda-calculus to generate a graphic design and could then directly manipulate the output to indirectly change design parameters (i.e. constant literals) in the program in real-time during the manipulation. Unfortunately, the burden of programming the desired relationships rested entirely on the user. \  \ In this paper, we design and implement new features for Sketch-n-Sketch that assist in the programming process itself. Like typical direct manipulation systems, our extended Sketch-n-Sketch now provides GUI-based tools for drawing shapes, relating shapes to each other, and grouping shapes together. Unlike typical systems, however, each tool carries out the user's intention by transforming their general-purpose program. This novel, semi-automated programming workflow allows the user to rapidly create high-level, reusable abstractions in the program while at the same time retaining direct manipulation capabilities.

In conventional methods, users decompose a volume into multiple regions iteratively, segment each region using a threshold, and then manually clean the segmentation result by removing clutter in each region. However, this is tedious and requires many mouse operations from different camera views. We propose an alternative approach whereby the user simply applies painting operations to the volume using tools commonly seen in painting systems, such as flood fill and brushes. This significantly reduces the number of mouse and camera control operations. Our technical contribution is in the introduction of the threshold field, which assigns spatially-varying threshold values to individual voxels. This generalizes discrete decomposition of a volume into regions and segmentation using a constant threshold in each region, thereby offering a much more flexible and efficient workflow.

We focus on attaching virtual images to non-static real life objects. In previous work, moving the real object causes latency in the superimposing system, and the virtual  image seems to follow the object with a delay. This is caused by delays due to sensors, displays and computational devices for position sensing, and occasionally actuators for moving the image generation source. In order to avoid this problem, this paper proposes to separate the object-anchored imaging effect from the position sensing. Our proposal is a retro-reflective system called ‘SkyAnchor,'’ which consists of only optical devices: two mirrors and an aerial-imaging plate. The system reflects light from a light source anchored under the physical object itself, and forms an image anchored around the object. This optical solution does not cause any latency in principle and is effective for high-quality mixed reality applications.

However, automated semantic modeling often falls short when people contribute short text snippets or sketches. Innovation platforms can employ humans to provide semantic judgments to construct a semantic model, but this relies on external workers completing a large number of tedious micro tasks. This requirement threatens both accuracy (external workers may lack expertise and context to make accurate semantic judgments) and scalability (external workers are costly). In this paper, we introduce IdeaHound, an ideation system that seamlessly integrates the task of defining semantic relationships among ideas into the primary task of idea generation. The system combines implicit human actions with machine learning to create a computational semantic model of the emerging solution space. The integrated nature of these judgments allows IdeaHound to leverage the expertise and efforts of participants who are already motivated to contribute to idea generation, overcoming the issues of scalability inherent to existing approaches. Our results show that participants were equally willing to use (and just as productive using) IdeaHound compared to a conventional platform that did not require organizing ideas. Our integrated crowdsourcing approach also creates a more accurate semantic model than an existing crowdsourced approach (performed by external crowds). We demonstrate how this model enables helpful creative interventions: providing diverse inspirational examples, providing similar ideas for a given idea and providing a visual overview of the solution space.  \ ",uist2629,Full,Boomerang: Rebounding the Consequences of Reputation Feedback on Crowdsourcing Platforms,52946,Snehalkumar (Neil),S,Gaikwad,snehgaikwad.cs@alumni.cmu.edu,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,MA,United States,,,,,,60263,Durim,,Morina,dmorina@cs.stanford.edu,,Stanford University,Stanford,California,United States,,,,,,55484,Adam,,Ginzberg,ginzberg@stanford.edu,,Stanford University,Stanford,CA,USA,,,,,,60264,Catherine,A,Mullings,cmullings@alumni.stanford.edu,,Stanford University,Stanford,California,United States,,,,,,53339,Shirish,,Goyal,shirish.goyal@gmail.com,,Stanford University,Palo Alto,California,United States,,,,,,43882,Dilrukshi,,Gamage,dilrukshi.gamage@gmail.com,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,University of Moratuwa,Katubedda,,Sri Lanka,,,,,,16321,Mark,Edmond,Whiting,mwhiting@andrew.cmu.edu,Integrated Design Innovation Group,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,PA,USA,,,,,,60244,Vibhor,,Sehgal,sehgalvibhor@gmail.com,,Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology,New Delhi,,India,,,,,,60265,Aaron,,Gilbee,Another.human.factor@gmail.com,,Independent Researcher ,Karlsruhe,,Germany,,,,,,60266,Mathias,,Burton,hello@mathiasburton.com,,ProQuest,Seattle,Washington,United States,,,,,,60267,Suminda Niranga,,Senadhipathige,nirangamail@gmail.com,,Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology,Malabe,,Sri Lanka,,,,,,60268,Alipta,,Ballav,alipta.ballav@harman.com,,Harman International ,Bangalore,,India,,,,,,60269,Jasmine,,Lin,hizai@uw.edu,,University of Washington,Seattle,Washington,United States,,,,,,41398,Sharon,,Zhou,sharon.waxseal@gmail.com,,Stanford University,Stanford,California,United States,,,,,,20699,Rajan,,Vaish,rvaish@cs.stanford.edu,,Stanford University,Palo Alto,California,United States,,,,,,7809,Michael,,Bernstein,msb@cs.stanford.edu,,Stanford University,Palo Alto,CA,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paid crowdsourcing platforms suffer from low-quality work and unfair rejections, but paradoxically, most workers and requesters have high reputation scores.

With Boomerang, requesters find that their highly-rated workers gain earliest access to their future tasks, and workers find tasks from their highly-rated requesters at the top of their task feed. Field experiments verify that Boomerang causes both workers and requesters to provide feedback that is more closely aligned with their private opinions.

As users interact with apps through ERICA, it detects UI changes, seamlessly records multiple data-streams in the background, and unifies them into a user interaction trace. Using ERICA we collected interaction traces from over a thousand popular Android apps. Leveraging this trace data, we built machine learning classifiers to detect elements and layouts indicative of 23 common user flows. User flows are an important component of UX design and consists of a sequence of UI states that represent semantically meaningful tasks such as searching or composing. With these classifiers, we identified and indexed more than 3000 flow examples, and released the largest online search engine of user flows in Android apps.",uist4274,Full,The Elements of Fashion Style,44386,Kristen,,Vaccaro,kvaccaro@illinois.edu,Computer Science,University of Illinois,Urbana,IL,USA,,,,,,60352,Sunaya,,Shivakumar,sshivak2@illinois.edu,Computer Science,University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,Urbana,Illinois,United States,,,,,,60351,Ziqiao,,Ding,zding5@illinois.edu,Computer Science,University of Illinois,Champaign,Illinois,USA,,,,,,2527,Karrie,,Karahalios,kkarahal@illinois.edu,Computer Science,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,Illinois,United States,,,,,,13333,Ranjitha,,Kumar,ranjitha@illinois.edu,Computer Science,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,Illinois,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The outfits people wear contain latent fashion concepts capturing styles, seasons, events, and environments. Fashion theorists have proposed that these concepts are shaped by design elements such as color, material, and silhouette. A dress may be ‘bohemian’ because of its pattern, material, trim, or some combination of them: it is not always clear how low-level elements translate to high-level styles. In this paper, we use polylingual topic modeling to learn latent fashion concepts jointly in two languages capturing these elements and styles. Using this latent topic formation we can translate between these two languages through topic space, exposing the elements of fashion style. We train the polylingual topic model (PLTM) on a set of more than half a million outfits collected from Polyvore, a popular fashion-based social net- work. We present novel, data-driven fashion applications that allow users to express their needs in natural language just as they would to a real stylist and produce tailored item recommendations for these style needs.",uist2549,Full,Multi-Device Storyboards for Cinematic Narratives in VR,17356,Rorik,,Henrikson,rorik@dgp.toronto.edu,DGP,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,22675,Bruno,,Araujo,brar@dgp.toronto.edu,Department of Computer Science,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,43372,Fanny,,Chevalier,fanny.chevalier@inria.fr,,Inria,Lille,,France,,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,4937,Karan,,Singh,karan@dgp.toronto.edu,,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,1019,Ravin,,Balakrishnan,ravin@dgp.toronto.edu,,University of Toronto,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Virtual Reality (VR) narratives have the unprecedented potential to connect with an audience through presence, placing viewers within the narrative. The onset of consumer VR has resulted in an explosion of interest in immersive storytelling. Planning narratives for VR, however, is a grand challenge due to its unique affordances, its evolving cinematic vocabulary, and most importantly the lack of supporting tools to explore the creative process in VR. \ In this paper, we distill key considerations with the planning process for VR stories, collected through a formative study conducted with film industry professionals. Based on these insights we propose a workflow, specific to the needs of professionals creating storyboards for VR film, and present a multi-device (tablet and head-mounted display) storyboard tool supporting this workflow.

Based on the analysis of design practices and drawing skills in the art and design literature, we suggest novel ideas for efficiently acquiring hand postures (palm-pinning widget, front and center mirrors, responsive spangles), for quickly creating and easily adjusting sketch planes (modified tick-triggered, orientable and shiftable sketch planes), for appropriately starting 3D sketching products with hand information (hand skeleton, grip axis), and for practically increasing user throughput (intensifier, rough and precise erasers)’all of which are coherently and consistently integrated in our system.

We introduce DemoDraw, a multi-modal approach to generate these illustrations as the user physically demonstrates the movements. In a Demonstration Interface, DemoDraw segments speech and 3D joint motion into a sequence of motion segments, each characterized by a key pose and salient joint trajectories. Based on this sequence, a series of illustrations is automatically generated using a stylistically rendered 3D avatar annotated with arrows to convey movements. During demonstration, the user can navigate using speech and amend or re-perform motions if needed. Once a suitable sequence of steps has been created, a Refinement Interface enables fine control of visualization parameters. In a three-part evaluation, we validate the effectiveness of the generated illustrations and the usability of DemoDraw. Our results show 4 to 7-step illustrations can be created in 5 or 10 minutes on average.",uist2498,Full,AggreGaze: Collective Estimation of Audience Attention on Public Displays,28124,Yusuke,,Sugano,sugano@mpi-inf.mpg.de,,Max Planck Institute for Informatics,Saarbrücken,,Germany,,,,,,60314,Xucong,,Zhang,xczhang@mpi-inf.mpg.de,,Max Planck Institute for Informatics,Saarbrücken,,Germany,,,,,,11540,Andreas,,Bulling,bulling@mpi-inf.mpg.de,,Max Planck Institute for Informatics,Saarbrücken,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gaze is frequently explored in public display research given its importance for monitoring and analysing audience attention. \ However, current gaze-enabled public display interfaces require either special-purpose eye tracking equipment or explicit personal calibration for each individual user. \ We present AggreGaze, a novel method for estimating spatio-temporal audience attention on public displays. \ Our method requires only a single off-the-shelf camera attached to the display, does not require any personal calibration, and provides visual attention estimates across the full display. \ We achieve this by 1) compensating for errors of state-of-the-art appearance-based gaze estimation methods through on-site training data collection, and by 2) aggregating uncalibrated and thus inaccurate gaze estimates of multiple users into joint attention estimates. \ We propose different visual stimuli for this compensation: a standard 9-point calibration, moving targets, text and visual stimuli embedded into the display content, as well as normal video content. \ Based on a two-week deployment in a public space, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for estimating attention maps that closely resemble ground-truth audience gaze distributions.",uist1366,Full,RadarCat: Radar Categorization for Input & Interaction,57232,Hui-Shyong,,Yeo,hsy@st-andrews.ac.uk,School of Computer Science,University of St Andrews,St Andrews,Fife,United Kingdom,,,,,,60431,Gergely,,Flamich,gf38@st-andrews.ac.uk,School of Computer Science,University of St Andrews,St Andrews,Fife,United Kingdom,,,,,,60432,Patrick,,Schrempf,ps90@st-andrews.ac.uk,School of Computer Science,University of St Andrews,St Andrews,Fife,United Kingdom,,,,,,46111,David,,Harris-Birtill,dcchb@st-andrews.ac.uk,School of Computer Science,University of St Andrews,St Andrews,Fife,United Kingdom,,,,,,17243,Aaron,,Quigley,aquigley@st-andrews.ac.uk,School of Computer Science,University of St Andrews,St Andrews,Fife,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In RadarCat we present a small, versatile radar-based system for material and object classification which enables new forms of everyday proximate interaction with digital devices.

We explore the influence of the wrist's bio-mechanical properties for performing gestures to interact with a smartwatch, both while standing still and walking. Through a user study, we examine the impact of performing 8 distinct gestures (4 directional marks, and 4 free-form shapes) on the stability of the watch surface. Participants were able to perform directional marks using the wrist as a joystick at an average rate of half a second and free-form shapes at an average rate of approximately 1.5secs.

In this paper we introduce a novel technique called gesture path stochastic resampling (GPSR) that is computationally efficient, has minimal coding overhead, and yet despite its simplicity is able to achieve higher accuracy than competitive, state-of-the-art approaches. GPSR generates synthetic samples by lengthening and shortening gesture subpaths within a given sample to produce realistic variations of the input via a process of nonuniform resampling. As such, GPSR is an appropriate rapid prototyping technique where ease of use, understandability, and efficiency are key. Further, through an extensive evaluation, we show that accuracy significantly improves when gesture recognizers are trained with GPSR synthetic samples. In some cases, mean recognition errors are reduced by more than 70%, and in most cases, GPSR outperforms two other evaluated state-of-the-art methods.",
