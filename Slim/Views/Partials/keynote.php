    <b>ABSTRACT</b>
    <br>
    A projector manipulates outgoing light rays, while a camera records incoming ones. Combining these optically inverse devices, especially in a coaxial manner, creates the possibility of a new computer-vision technology. The “Smart Headlight,” currently under development at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, is one example:   a device that can “erase” raindrops or snowflakes from a driver’s sight, allowing for continuous use of the “high beams” mode while not causing glare against oncoming drivers, and enhance the appearance of important objects, such as pedestrians.  In that sense, it constitutes a “genuine” augmented reality, manipulating the reality for how it appears to a viewer, rather than merely overlaying objects on the image of the reality. This talk will present the state of the Smart Headlight project and discuss further possible applications of projector-camera systems.

    <b>ABSTRACT</b>
    <br>
    A single design is one molecule that contributes to the atmosphere of the whole environment”. This is the basic idea of design in this age.
    <br>
    That is to say, designing today seems to embodying the subject by its surroundings, rather than by the subject itself.

    <b>BIO</b>
    <br>
    Product Designer Born in 1956. Designing shape is to give form to values that people tacitly share and wish for. Naoto Fukasawa visually captures these values and he draws the exact outline of them. His ability for visualising such unseen outlines for things is not easily worded and described, nonetheless, people are convinced with his ability when they experience his design.
    Fukasawa’s notions and expressions to approach essential values of things through design travel beyond borders or domains and his thoughts are well respected internationally. His concept for finding hints in subconscious behaviour of people which he named “Without Thought”, is most known and he runs “Without Thought” workshops to share his thoughts.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fukasawa collaborates with world leading companies and brands in such countries as Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Scandinavian countries and Asian countries while consulting Japanese leading companies locally. His area of work is broad and he works with various fields in design beyond categories.Consulting works for Japanese companies are mainly focused on evaluating their cooperate strategies in line with the mean of sociality and how we define quality of life in order to direct the companies towards where society is inevitably heading. Such consulting work extends as far as to visualise design for their products which marks the company’s social responsibilities as well as to visualise their cooperate strategies and Fukasawa‘s work for consulting has led them to many successful results.
