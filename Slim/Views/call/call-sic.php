  <h2>CONTEST ANNOUNCEMENT</h2>
  <div class="text">
    <img class="ui medium right floated image" src="<?php echo BASE_PATH; ?>/lib/img/call/sic/boards.jpg">
    For 2016, the UIST Student Innovation Contest takes on a very timely subject which is the next frontier in virtual and augmented reality: feeling the virtual (haptics)! You will help create a world in which virtual interfaces are no longer just wireframes without mass... you can use electrical muscle stimulation to create physical forces from the virtual world and... you can even make it mobile/wearable so that these interfaces are with us everywhere!
    <br>
    <br>
    Each team will <a href="http://plopes.org/ems" target="_blank">receive a kit of parts</a> including an arduino nano, the medically-safe muscle stimulator, electrodes and our usb/bluetooth control board. Using these parts, teams will be able to build virtual experiences, devices, interfaces that demonstrate how to make the virtual physical. We will also be providing you with <a href="https://github.com/PedroLopes/openEMSstim" target="_blank">simple examples on how to get started using Arduino, Unity3D and Processing</a>. All teams are encouraged to open source their efforts, and even build on each other’s work. To get you started easily, we will provide you, besides all the hardware, <a href="https://github.com/PedroLopes/openEMSstim/tree/master/start-here-tutorials" target="_blank">video tutorials</a> and coaching sessions so you know how to setup everything and debug any questions you might have!

    The simplest demo you can build is one that renders a virtual event into a physical event, for instance a mobile phone game in which you actually steer an airplane against the wind (spoiler alert: we've done this one, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swmGaGT8lvs">video here</a>). Because using EMS makes interfaces more physical, when the wind comes one of the player's wrists contracts (using the muscle stimulation) and turns the airplane into an undesired direction, thus the player must turn against the force-feedback and steer the airplane into safety!
    <strong>
      What other futuristic mobile apps can you make that use EMS?
    </strong>
    A more compelling demo that you can build takes place in Virtual Reality, what could you improve in the experience of virtual reality if the user could feel forces? Check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5e4mXQLq54">video example</a> for inspiration, here you see Virtual Reality sport simulators such as boxing and baseball that actually deliver a force. Here we combined the EMS bracelet with a solenoid...
    <strong>
      what other novel techniques and devices can you combine EMS with?
    </strong>
    You can even combine it with everyday items and make them smarter: what if while the user is manipulating an object you could actuate and change the way they physically handle the object? Check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz4dphzBb6I" target="_balnk">video for inspiration in which we made a spray can shake by itself</a>. What about <b>teaching a new skill</b> using electrical muscle stimulation? Maybe playing a new instrument: get inspired with the amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XBoZyfB8hY" target="_blank">Possessed Hand video</a>.
    <strong>
      Think outside the box and create novel interfaces that take advantage of these physical sensations for augmented or virtual reality
    </strong>
    or maybe you don't even need screens! The more exciting your demo gets the higher are the chances for
    the prize committee to be impressed.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3>Hardware and Software</h3>
  <div class="text">
    Q: What is EMS? A: EMS is Electrical Muscle Stimulation. It is a technique from rehabilitation medicine that allows to contract muscles by sending small (mA scale) electrical impulses via  electrodes attached to the skin.
    <br><br>
    Q: How do we use EMS on our project? A: We use EMS without needing to tamper or alter any hardware. We use a medically compliant electrical muscle stimulator and a control board. The control board is able to attenuate the muscle stimulation signal (i.e., make it smaller). The board is galvanically isolated from the stimulator, i.e., the board's arduino is not on the same circuit of the stimulator. You can control the board by simply sending bluetooth messages, from your phone or laptop.
    <br><br>
    Q: Do I get to keep the hardware after the contest? A: Yes, if you always use it safely as instructed.
    <br><br>
    Q: Are we allowed to develop our demos in programming languages other than the ones used in the provided examples? A: You are welcome to write your own ports for different languages and develop your demos in any language, however we cannot provide any technical support, and we highly recommend using Java/Processing/Python and Arduino as they are easy cross-platform languages.
    <br><br>
    Q: Can we start developing our idea before the hardware arrives? A: Yes! You can start as soon as you’d like. We’ll try to provide the 3D models and control software at the time of team notifications so you can get started.
  </div>
  <h3>Registration and Eligibility</h3>
  <div class="text">
    Q: I am not a student, can I still participate? A: Unfortunately, no. The contest is limited to students at all levels (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD).
    <br><br>
    Q: I'm in high school, can I participate in the contest? A: All students are welcome. However, you will have to be old enough (at least 18 years old) and able to travel to the UIST Conference in Tokyo, Japan.
    <br><br>
    Q: I'm an international student, can I participate in the contest? A: Yes. International students at all levels are encouraged to participate. You will be responsible for your own travel and arrangements.
    <br><br>
    Q: Are postdocs eligible to participate in the contest? A: Unfortunately, no. Postdocs are expected to pay the full registration rate at the UIST conference and thus are not considered students. To maintain fairness among all teams, this means they are not eligible to participate.
    <br><br>
    Q: What happens if I wish to withdraw from the contest? A: Teams are welcome to withdraw. Please email the contest chairs at least 2 weeks before the conference. Keep in mind you might be asked to return the hardware provided. If you are seeking conference registration reimbursement, your reimbursement will not be processed until you have returned the hardware kit.
  </div>
  <h3>Teams</h3>
  <div class="text">
    Q: How many teams will be selected to participate in the contest? A: Based on space and power limitations at the venue, we will be selecting a maximum of 20 teams. We reserve the right to change this number based on a number of factors (including number of teams registered, ideas submitted, team composition, etc.).
    <br><br>
    Q: Is there a waiting list for team selection? A: If accepted teams decide to withdraw or do not register for the conference within a week of selection notification, additional teams may be invited to participate. We will only contact additional teams if spots opens up.
    <br><br>
    Q: Can one person be a member of multiple teams? A: Unfortunately, no. Please decide to be part of one team for the contest. We also encourage students at the same institution to form full groups of 4 students, instead of smaller teams.
    <br><br>
    Q: Can teams be composed of students from different schools? A: Yes, definitely. Simply enter the school name of your team captain at the top of the registration form. Then, enter the school names for your other members in the section for each additional member.
    <br><br>
    Q: Can student members be removed or added from teams after the registration deadline? A: Yes, we are allowing for student members to be added or removed up until 2 weeks before the contest. The team captain or student registered for the conference cannot withdraw, otherwise the team will forfeit their participation. Email the contest organizers as soon as possible to make any changes.
