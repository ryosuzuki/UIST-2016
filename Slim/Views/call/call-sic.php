Student Innovation Contest
Welcome to the eighth annual UIST Student Innovation Contest (SIC) taking place in Tokyo!
TL;DR: The next quantum leap in human-computer interfaces is making the feeling the virtual world. In this contest you will use a simple, yet powerful technology borrowed from rehabilitation medicine, to make this possible: Electrical Muscle Stimulation. Using EMS you can create strong physical sensations such as forces with wearable hardware. Join the UIST SIC and be one of the first to develop new exciting haptic sensations for applications such as virtual and augmented reality! Win fabulous prizes! Sign up at http://tinyurl.com/uistsic2016 by August 1st of 2016.
In the UIST Student Innovation Contest student teams create intriguing novel interfaces using exciting hardware kits that we provide, this year it is: Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS). It’s your opportunity to shine and impress the world with your innovations! Contestants will demo their creations during the demo reception at the conference in Tokyo Japan; and the winners will be announced at the UIST banquet. A jury of UIST celebrities will select two winners in the Most Creative Interface and Best Implementation categories. On top of that, conference attendees will get a chance to vote for their favorite teams in the People's Choice category.
Important dates
student contest registration deadline for all teams : August 1
organizers evaluate submissions and select accepted teams : August 1-2
notification of team selection sent out : August 3
hardware kits shipped to accepted teams (as soon as possible after one team member is registered to the conference) : August 4
contest development period with muscle-stimulation hardware : August 4 - October 17
teams demo at contest reception during UIST conference (Tokyo) : October 17
CONTEST ANNOUNCEMENT
For 2016, the UIST Student Innovation Contest takes on a very timely subject which is the next frontier in virtual and augmented reality: feeling the virtual (haptics)! You will help create a world in which virtual interfaces are no longer just wireframes without mass... you can use electrical muscle stimulation to create physical forces from the virtual world and... you can even make it mobile/wearable so that these interfaces are with us everywhere!
Each team will receive a kit of parts including an arduino nano, the medically-safe muscle stimulator, electrodes and our usb/bluetooth control board. Using these parts, teams will be able to build virtual experiences, devices, interfaces that demonstrate how to make the virtual physical. We will also be providing you with simple examples on how to get started using Arduino, Unity3D and Processing. All teams are encouraged to open source their efforts, and even build on each other’s work. To get you started easily, we will provide you, besides all the hardware, video tutorials and coaching sessions so you know how to setup everything and debug any questions you might have!
Demo applications and more ideas to build
The simplest demo you can build is one that renders a virtual event into a physical event, for instance a mobile phone game in which you actually steer an airplane against the wind (spoiler alert: we've done this one, check out the video here). Because using EMS makes interfaces more physical, when the wind comes one of the player's wrists contracts (using the muscle stimulation) and turns the airplane into an undesired direction, thus the player must turn against the force-feedback and steer the airplane into safety! What other futuristic mobile apps can you make that use EMS? A more compelling demo that you can build takes place in Virtual Reality, what could you improve in the experience of virtual reality if the user could feel forces? Check this video example for inspiration, here you see Virtual Reality sport simulators such as boxing and baseball that actually deliver a force. Here we combined the EMS bracelet with a solenoid... what other novel techniques and devices can you combine EMS with? You can even combine it with everyday items and make them smarter: what if while the user is manipulating an object you could actuate and change the way they physically handle the object? Check this video for inspiration in which we made a spray can shake by itself. Think outside the box and create novel interfaces that take advantage of these physical sensations for augmented or virtual reality or maybe you don't even need screens! The more exciting your demo gets the higher are the chances for the prize committee to be impressed.
REGISTRATION PROCESS
Here's the 6 easy steps to participate:
write a 100-word description of your idea
prepare a link to a picture/drawing/storyboard or sketch of your demo idea
register for the UIST contest by fulling out the following form by August 1st: http://tinyurl.com/uistsic2016
await notification and further instructions. Your team will be notified of our decision via email.
for accepted teams, one of your team members MUST register for the UIST conference and pay the registration fee or inform us that you have been accepted as a student volunteer.
once we've confirmed your UIST conference registration, we will ship you the hardware kit and arrange a skype meeting with you to get you started!
Still have questions or confused? Drop us an email at: studentinnovation@uist.org
CONTEST RULES AND DETAILS
pre-selection criteria: organizers will select a maximum of 20 teams, judging your demo descriptions and sketches by the following criteria: complexity of idea, time and resources required to build, and creativity of idea.
team size: the minimum team size is 1, the maximum is 4
team composition: an individual student cannot be a part of multiple teams
eligibility requirement: you MUST be a student to participate in this contest. Students of all levels (high school, bachelor's, master's, PhD) are encouraged to participate. International students are welcome.
registration requirement: you must register for the contest and submit your idea and image link. If your team is accepted, at least one of your team members MUST register for the conference (or be accepted as a student volunteer). This is for three reasons: 1) you have to demo your idea, 2) you have to claim your prizes, and 3) UIST is an awesome conference!
demo ideas: during the contest voting period, teams will be allowed to demo one idea. Different demos of the same idea are permitted.
demo code: We encourage you to open-source your code. The organizers will create a github organization where all teams will be expected to post their code (don’t worry, we will not judge you on your code!).
demo safety: We will provide you guides to follow and a skype meeting to help you get started. It is mandatory to read our guide on EMS and follow always the correct procedure. Please be careful!
hardware provided: Muscle stimulation device (rehabilitation device), control board, arduino nano, electrodes.
hardware modifications: No not modify the control board. Discuss any hardware modification with us first. Also, there is no need to modify the software of the control board, if you need some new feature discuss it with us.
additional equipment: teams must bring supporting computers and hardware to run their demos, including the hardware shipped by the contest organizers. No extra equipment will be handed out at UIST.
powering your demos at the contest: a Japanese-standard power strip will be provided for each team at their demo table. However, we recommend that you bring your own regional power strip with the appropriate US adapter to connect all your hardware through your own strip with a single adapter.
WiFi availability: WiFi in the conference hall will likely be slow, however teams are welcome to use WiFi as a part of their demos. We recommend having a Plan B in case WiFi is too slow in the conference center.
questions: if you have any questions about the contest rules, please contact the contest chairs.

<h2 id="contest-announcement">CONTEST ANNOUNCEMENT</h2>
<p>For 2015, the UIST Student Innovation Contest takes on a cause. Schools and museums are starting to offer experimental Animatronics classes where kids build furry robotic animals and use them to tell amazing stories. These courses blur traditional lines - between art and engineering, between the virtual and physical worlds - all while demonstrating the universality of creativity across disciplines. Everybody learns how to write stories, build mechanisms, program motions, provide voice performances, etc. In this way, kids see how it all works together, and it has a way of inspiring kids to see new career possibilities.</p>
<p>One challenge for these courses has been the lack of good software tools. Professional animatronics authoring and show control packages have considerable cost and unnecessary complexity. Standard mechanical design tools are similarly problematic. For these classes to grow beyond a small number of well-funded, expert instructors, we need easy-to-use, open source software. Our contest partners for this year are teachers deploying animatronics in their classrooms <strong>right now</strong>, who want to see software and hardware innovations to broaden the stories their high schoolers can tell.</p>
<p>Each team will receive a kit of parts including servo motors, cables, controller, power supply, and a stage puppet to animate. Using these parts, teams will be able to build their own animatronic characters to demonstrate the tools they create. We will also be providing an SDK that demonstrates how to talk to the controller using a common file format. All teams will be required to open source their efforts, and will be encouraged to build on each other’s work.</p>
<p>The simplest animatronics shows consist of one servo and one audio track: the servo moves a character in time to the speech. Complexity increases as more servos and more audio tracks are added, allowing multiple characters to interact. But how are the characters’ movements created? For example, could puppet motions be authored by demonstration using a Kinect or by moving the puppets directly? How is the audio scripted? Perhaps a high-level storyboarding tool, with actions and voice tracks attached to boards, could help. And how do things get more complicated when audience interaction is involved, creating non-linear stories and integrating sensors? How do we best support multiple characters interacting with each other? &quot;Macros&quot; for animatronics could be implemented, for example to ensure that characters display a &quot;breathing&quot; animation at all times that they aren&#39;t specifically programmed to do something else. Programming is within reach of today&#39;s high school students, but creating UIs for animatronics storytelling can support more complex narratives, and there are scores of possibilities for new UIs!</p>
<p>On the hardware side, animatronic puppets are, at their heart, mechanical! Their skeletons are built from standard-size servos and (often) aluminum, but the customization possibilities are infinite. 3D printing or laser cutting can create unique character parts, like snap-on eyes or arms. They can also help define the structure of the animatronics skeleton: could there be a tool for drawing desired motions and calculating the 3D printed parts and servos needed to make them? Or a tool to match a puppet body to a set of servos and parts that could make its motion look natural? What sorts of hardware components could facilitate emotional displays in puppets; can we create &quot;emotion kits&quot; for sadness, happiness, or anger?</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see your exciting innovations. Please watch the video below for more inspiration!</p>
