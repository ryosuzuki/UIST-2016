  <h1>UIST 2016 Call for Participation</h1>
  <h2>
    PAPERS (Deadline: Wednesday April 13, 2016 12:00 PDT)
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    Papers are the main medium for conveying new research results at UIST. Submissions are sought that describe original, unpublished work on user interface interaction techniques, systems, tools, services, devices, applications, or metaphors. Please consult the <a href="http://uist.acm.org/uist2016/author-guide" target="_blank">UIST 2016 Author's Guide</a> for information on submission format and policies for previous and simultaneous publications. Note that paper submissions must be anonymous! <b>Authors must remove their names and affiliations from the masthead and <u>refer to their own previous work in third person</u> when possible.</b> See the anonymization policy in the Author’s Guide for more information.
  </div>

  <h2>
    Appropriate Topics
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    Appropriate topics include but are not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Significantly novel enabling technologies such as innovative input devices, new interaction techniques, or new media that extend the boundaries of traditional interaction, such as natural user interfaces, augmented reality, mobile interaction, haptics and tactile interfaces, ubiquitous computing (including wearables), social software, and computer-supported collaborative work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Novel interactive hardware prototypes, prototype fabrication methods or tools, or processes for creating user experiences that involve physical devices, sensors, prototypes, or systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Innovative user interfaces for difficult interaction contexts or challenging applications. Examples include managing large, complex information sets, usable privacy and security, multi-user interaction, crowdsourcing, fabrication, or techniques that span devices distributed in time and space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Breakthrough user experiences leveraging techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics, speech processing, networking, or human perception and cognition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Innovative software architectures, tools, toolkits, programming systems, development environments, tutorial and help systems that support the development and use of the above technologies in user interfaces.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Authors of all accepted papers will also be invited and encouraged to participate in the demo session.
    <br>
    All papers should be submitted electronically to: <a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi" target="_blank">http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi</a>.

  <h2>Paper Length and Presentation Time</h2>
  <div class="text">
    Papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the size of the contribution. References do not count in page length. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format. Exceptionally long papers (more than 10 pages) need to include very strong contributions to warrant acceptance. Shorter, focused papers (called Tech Notes in years prior to 2011) are still an appropriate submission length for UIST. Papers with length disproportionate to their contribution will be rejected. In rare cases, authors may be requested to shorten papers in a camera-ready, for example by removing sections that detract from a paper’s main contribution.
    Presentation time during the conference will be allocated according to the weight of contribution. Papers that are 6 or fewer pages will have shorter presentation times than longer papers at the conference. However, there will be no distinction made between papers based on length in the program, proceedings or digital library. Exact talk durations will be determined when the program is finalized.
  </div>

  <h2>
    Submission Requirements
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    When you submit your work, you will be asked to agree to the terms and conditions of the <a href="https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/sigchi-submitter-agreement/" target="_blank">SIGCHI Submitter Agreement</a>. In addition, the author list must be complete by the submission deadline. Late author changes require approval from Program Chairs and may be declined or require paper withdrawal because of reviewing conflicts.
  </div>

  <h2>
    Videos
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    The submission of supplementary videos is strongly encouraged. Especially in cases of interactive techniques or systems, videos play an important role in convincing reviewers that the contribution described works and works well. Videos should be no more than five minutes long and the total size of a submission (including the paper) is limited to 100 MB. See the <a href="http://uist.acm.org/uist2016/video-guide" target="_blank">video guide</a> for details.
  </div>

  <h2>
    Reviewing and Rebuttal Process
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    Rigorous reviewing is a UIST hallmark. Each paper will be fully reviewed by 3 external reviewers (experts in the area who are not on the Program Committee). Primary reviewers from the Program Committee will write meta-reviews for all papers. Full reviews will be provided by primary reviewers when necessary. If reviews rise above a rebuttal threshold, secondary reviewers from the Program Committee will also provide a review. On June 9, 2016, authors will be notified of their review results. If reviews fall below a rebuttal threshold, the paper will be rejected at this stage; otherwise, the authors will have the opportunity to submit a rebuttal.
  </div>

  <h2>
    Conditional Acceptance
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    All acceptances will be conditional pending changes that the Program Committee may suggest or require for the final camera-ready paper. This means that a paper will not be accepted to UIST until authors revise and submit the final camera-ready paper for approval by the Program Committee. The length of the camera-ready paper must be less than or equal to the length of the original submission unless there is a strong justification for increasing the paper length, which would require approval by the authors’ primary reviewer.
  </div>

  <h2>
    Video Previews
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    Video previews are 30-second clips that are used to describe and showcase a paper before, during, and after the conference. <u>Video previews are mandatory accompanying material for all papers that will be presented at UIST.</u> Please carefully read the <a href="http://uist.acm.org/uist2016/video-previews" target="_blank">Video Preview instructions</a> and submit your Video Preview in the dedicated "Video Preview" field of your final submission at <a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sighchi"  target="_blank">http://www.precisionconference.com/~sighchi</a>.
  </div>

  <h2>
    Format
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    All paper submissions must be made in the <b><u>2014</u></b> version of the <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform" target="_blank">SIGCHI papers format</a>. (Note that this format utilizes the “Lastname, F.M.” author-name reference style, not the more recent “Firstname M. Lastname” convention.)
  </div>

  <h2>
    Public Dissemination Date
  </h2>
  <div class="text">
    The title and abstract of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the final camera-ready paper deadline (Aug. 10, 2016). Note, however, that this is NOT the official publication date.
    <br>
    <br>
    The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to three weeks prior to the first day of the conference, which is Oct. 16, 2016. Therefore, the official publication date, also known as the official public dissemination date, may be as early as Sept. 25, 2016. (This date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.)
    <br>
    In addition, video previews will be released on Sept. 25, 2016, three weeks before the start of the conference.
