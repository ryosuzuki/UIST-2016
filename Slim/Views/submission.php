          The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) is the premier forum for innovations in human-computer interfaces. Sponsored by ACM special interest groups on computer-human interaction (SIGCHI) and computer graphics (SIGGRAPH), UIST brings together people from diverse areas including graphical & web user interfaces, tangible & ubiquitous computing, virtual & augmented reality, multimedia, new input & output devices, and CSCW. The intimate size and intensive program make UIST an ideal opportunity to exchange research results and ideas. Join us in Tokyo!

      <div class="fourteen wide column centered">
        <div class="text">
          Appropriate topics include but are not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Significantly novel enabling technologies such as innovative input devices, new interaction techniques, or new media that extend the boundaries of traditional interaction, such as natural user interfaces, augmented reality, mobile interaction, haptics and tactile interfaces, ubiquitous computing (including wearables), social software, and computer-supported collaborative work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Novel interactive hardware prototypes, prototype fabrication methods or tools, or processes for creating user experiences that involve physical devices, sensors, prototypes, or systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Innovative user interfaces for difficult interaction contexts or challenging applications. Examples include managing large, complex information sets, usable privacy and security, multi-user interaction, crowdsourcing, fabrication, or techniques that span devices distributed in time and space.
            </li>
            <li>
              Breakthrough user experiences leveraging techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics, speech processing, networking, or human perception and cognition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Innovative software architectures, tools, toolkits, programming systems, development environments, tutorial and help systems that support the development and use of the above technologies in user interfaces.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Authors of all accepted papers will also be invited and encouraged to participate in the demo session.
          <br>
          All papers should be submitted electronically to: <a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi" target="_blank">http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi</a>.
