          You are invited to support the UIST 2016 conference. This is an ideal way to demonstrate your organization's interest in and commitment to the field of user interface software and technology, and to publicize this support to many leaders and students in the field.
          Corporate support is typically used to permit a greater number of students to attend UIST at reduced fees without artificially increasing the general registration, and to allow student volunteers to receive complimentary registration. Corporate support can also be targeted to a particular event or activity at the UIST Conference.
          <span class="ui horizontal divider"></span>
          The UIST 2016 conference has four corporate support levels:
          <a href="#platinum">Platinum</a>, <a href="#gold">Gold</a>, <a href="#silver">Silver</a>, and <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a>. We are also pleased to introduce this year the <a href="#friend">Friends of UIST</a> sponsorship level for individuals who wish to contribute to the conference.
          Your support is very important to the conference, and the conference committee ensures that these contributions are well recognized. We list the benefits and costs below. (If you can think of another benefit that would make this more attractive to your company, do let us know!)
          <b>If you are interested in supporting UIST 2015, please contact our sponsorship chair:</b>

          A Friend of UIST is an individual member of the community who has chosen to help contribute financially to the conference. Although only individuals may be listed as a "Friend of UIST," organizations may choose to provide this funding level for their employees. An individual may also choose to "top up" to the Friend of UIST level during the normal conference registration process by contributing the difference between their registration fee and the Friend of UIST contribution level. For example, if your registration cost is $800 then only a $200 donation would be required to obtain Friend of UIST recognition.

          1 free registration to attend the conference (unless the recognition is obtained by topping up a new or existing registration)
