<h1 id="uist-2015-call-for-participation">UIST 2015 Call for Participation</h1>
<h3 id="papers-deadline-tuesday-april-14-2015-17-00-pdt-">PAPERS (Deadline: Tuesday April 14, 2015 17:00 PDT)</h3>
<p>Papers are the main medium for conveying new research results at UIST. Submissions are sought that describe original, unpublished work on user interface interaction techniques, services, devices, applications, or metaphors. Please consult the <a href="author-guide">UIST 2015 Author&#39;s Guide</a> for information on submission format and policies for previous and simultaneous publications. Note that paper submissions must be anonymous! <b>Authors must remove their names and affiliations from the masthead and refer to their own previous work in third person when possible.</b> See the anonymization policy in the author’s guide for more information.</p>
<h3 id="appropriate-topics">Appropriate Topics</h3>
<p>Appropriate topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly novel enabling technologies such as innovative input devices, displays, new interaction techniques, or new media that extend the boundaries of traditional interaction, such as natural user interfaces and interactions, augmented reality, mobile interaction, haptics and tactile feedback interfaces, ubiquitous computing (including wearables), social software, and computer-supported collaborative work</li>
<li>Innovative user interfaces for difficult interaction contexts or challenging applications. Examples include managing large, complex information sets, usable privacy and security, multi-user interaction, crowdsourcing, fabrication, or techniques that span devices distributed in time and space</li>
<li>Breakthrough user experiences leveraging techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics, speech processing, networking, or human perception and cognition</li>
<li>Innovative software architectures, design tools, toolkits, programming systems, development environments, tutorial and help systems that support the development and use of the above technologies in user interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors of all accepted papers will also be invited and encouraged to participate in the demo session.</p>
<p>All papers should be submitted electronically to: <a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi">http://www.precisionconference.com/~sigchi</a>.</p>
<h3 id="paper-length">Paper Length</h3>
<p>Papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format. Exceptionally long papers (more than 10 pages) need to include very strong contributions to warrant acceptance. Shorter, more focused papers (called Tech Notes in years prior to 2011) are highly encouraged. Papers with length disproportionate to their contribution will be rejected. In exceptional cases the authors may be requested to shorten papers in the camera ready, for example by removing sections that detract from the paper’s main contribution.</p>
<p>Presentation time during the conference will be allocated according to the weight of contribution. Papers that are 6 or fewer pages will have shorter presentation times than longer papers at the conference (also see discussion on paper length in the above section). However, there will be no distinction made between papers in the program, proceedings or digital library. Exact talk durations will be determined when the program is finalized.</p>
<h3 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h3>
<p>New this year, when you submit your work, you will be asked to agree to the terms and conditions of the <a href="http://chi2015.acm.org/authors/sigchi-submitter-agreement/">SIGCHI Submitter Agreement</a>. In addition, the author list must be complete by the submission deadline. Late author changes require approval from program chairs and may be declined or require paper withdrawal because of review conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="videos">Videos</h3>
<p>The submission of supplementary videos is highly encouraged. Especially in cases of interactive systems, videos play a crucial role in convincing the reviewers that the system presented works and works well. Videos should be no more than five minutes long and the total size of your submission (including the paper) is limited to 100MB. See the <a href="video-guide">video guide</a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-and-rebuttal-process">Reviewing and Rebuttal Process</h3>
<p>Rigorous reviewing is a UIST hallmark. Each paper will be fully reviewed by 3 external reviewers (experts in the area that are not on the committee). Primary reviewers (from the papers committee) will write meta reviews for all papers. Full reviews will be provided when necessary. On June 3, 2015, authors will be notified of their review results. If reviews fall below a rebuttal threshold, the paper will be rejected at this stage, otherwise, the authors will have the opportunity to submit a rebuttal. Secondary reviewers (from the papers committee) will then write meta reviews for all remaining papers.</p>
<h3 id="conditional-acceptance">Conditional Acceptance</h3>
<p>All acceptances will be conditional pending changes that the papers committee may suggest or require for the final camera-ready draft. This means that a paper will not be accepted to UIST until authors revise and submit the final draft for approval by the program committee. The length of the camera-ready copy must be less or equal to the length of the original submission unless there is a strong justification for increasing the paper length, which should be agreed upon by the author&#39;s primary reviewer. </p>
<h3 id="video-previews">Video Previews</h3>
<p>Video previews are 30 second videos that are used to describe and showcase your work before, during, and after the conference. Video previews are mandatory accompanying material for all papers that will be presented at the conference. Please carefully read the <a href="http://www.acm.org/uist/uist2014/videopreviews.php">Video Preview instructions</a> and submit your Video Preview in the dedicated &quot;Video Preview&quot; field of your final submission at <a href="http://www.precisionconference.com/~sighchi">http://www.precisionconference.com/~sighchi</a>.</p>
<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>All paper submissions must be made in the 2014 version of the <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform">SIGCHI papers format</a>.</p>
<h3 id="public-dissemination-date">Public Dissemination Date</h3>
<p>The title and abstract of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the final camera-ready deadline (Aug 7, 2015). </p>
<p>The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference (Oct 25, 2015). The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. </p>
<p>In addition, video previews will be released two weeks before the start of the conference (Oct 25, 2015).  </p>
