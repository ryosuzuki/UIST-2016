          The conference venue is a university facility and we do not have any designated conference hotels. Please book a nearby hotel room by yourself. Early booking is strongly recommendaed becuase of constant shortage of hotel rooms in Tokyo. There are several hotels around the conference venue within walking distance. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zEQrhkQOwr5o.ks2qkUiXn81c&usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b><i class="fa fa-map-o fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Open Google Maps</b></a>
